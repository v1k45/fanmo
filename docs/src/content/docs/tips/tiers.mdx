Fanmo's Tipping Tiers feature is a fantastic way for creators to reward their most generous supporters with unique perks and recognition. By enabling tipping tiers, you can offer fans an enhanced experience based on the amount they tip. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and leverage tipping tiers effectively.

## What Are Tipping Tiers?

Tipping tiers allow creators to differentiate their fans based on the amount they tip. Depending on the tip amount, fans receive varying levels of recognition and interaction with the creator. This system provides incentives for fans to contribute more while giving creators an opportunity to acknowledge their support.

## Key Benefits of Tipping Tiers

Here are some of the key benefits of using tipping tiers on Fanmo:

### Encourage Generosity

Tipping tiers motivate fans to be more generous with their support. Knowing they'll receive extra perks at higher tip levels can incentivize them to contribute more.

### Recognize Your Biggest Supporters

Tipping tiers allow creators to recognize and reward their most dedicated and supportive fans. It's a way of saying "thank you" to those who go above and beyond.

### Foster Fan Engagement

Fans who reach higher tipping tiers often get exclusive benefits, such as longer messages with their tips. This fosters deeper engagement between creators and fans.

### Create a Sense of Community

Fans at different tipping tiers may identify with one another, creating a sense of community among supporters of the same creator.

## How Tipping Tiers Work

Tipping tiers are typically organized into levels, with each level corresponding to a specific tip amount. As fans increase their tips, they unlock higher tiers and enjoy the associated benefits.

Here's an example of how tipping tiers might be structured:

- **Minimum Amount (Level 1):** ₹50 - Fans at this level can send messages with their tips. They can send a message upto 65 characters long.

- **Level 2:** ₹100 - Fans at this level may have longer message lengths or additional perks. They can send a message upto 175 characters long.

- **Level 3:** ₹250 - Fans at this level could enjoy even more extended message lengths and more exclusive benefits. They can send a message upto 225 characters long.

- **Level 4:** ₹500 - The rewards become increasingly appealing as fans tip more. They can send a message upto 250 characters long.

- **Level 5:** ₹1,000 - At this level, fans may receive the highest recognition and the most extensive engagement opportunities. They can send a message upto 300 characters long.

- **Level 6:** ₹2,500 - Fans at this level may receive the most exclusive perks and recognition. They can send a message upto 350 characters long.

- **Level 7:** ₹5,000 - Fans at this level are the most dedicated and supportive. They can send a message upto 500 characters long.

Fans who choose to tip an amount lower than Level 1 will not be able to send a message with their tip. However, they can still enjoy the benefits of being a fan of the creator.
