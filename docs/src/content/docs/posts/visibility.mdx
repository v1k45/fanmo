When creating and sharing posts on Fanmo, it's essential to understand post visibility options. Fanmo provides you with the flexibility to control who can access your content. In this guide, we'll explain the different post visibility settings and how to use them effectively to engage with your audience.

## Post Visibility Options

Fanmo offers three primary post visibility settings:

1. **Public:** This setting makes your post visible to everyone, including users who are not your members or subscribers. Public posts are an excellent way to attract new fans and showcase your content to a broader audience.

2. **All Members:** With this option, your post is accessible to all your members, regardless of their membership tier. It's an ideal choice when you want to share content exclusively with your supporters and ensure that all members can see it.

3. **Selected Members:** This setting allows you to restrict post visibility to specific membership tiers. You can choose which tiers have access to your content, ensuring that certain posts are exclusively for higher-tier members.

## How to Set Visibility

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set the visibility for your Fanmo posts:

1. **Log In:** Sign in to your Fanmo creator account.

2. **Access Your Dashboard:** Navigate to your creator dashboard.

3. **Create or Edit a Post:** Start creating a new post or edit an existing one.

4. **Choose Your Visibility:** Look for the post visibility options, located below the post editor.

5. **Select the Visibility Setting:** Choose the visibility setting that best suits your content and goals.

6. **Save or Publish Your Post:** Once you've selected the desired visibility setting, save or publish your post.

## Best Practices

Understanding how to use post visibility effectively can significantly impact your fan engagement and monetization strategy. Here are some best practices:

1. **Engage New Fans with Public Posts:** Consider using public posts to attract new fans and provide a taste of your exclusive content. Engaging public content can encourage users to subscribe or tip you.

2. **Reward Your Subscribers:** Use "All Members" posts to provide exclusive updates or content to your loyal subscribers. It's a great way to show appreciation for their support.

3. **Offer Premium Content:** Create posts exclusively for higher-tier members by choosing the "Selected Members" option. This encourages fans to subscribe to higher tiers for access to premium content.

4. **Balance Your Content:** Strive for a balance between public and exclusive content to maintain fan engagement and attract new supporters while rewarding your dedicated subscribers.

By understanding and utilizing post visibility settings effectively, you can optimize your content strategy on Fanmo, engage your audience, and create a thriving community of fans and supporters.
