## Registration

Fanmo will ask you to provide some basic information to create your account. Here's what you can expect on the registration form:

### Display Name

Choose a display name that represents you as a creator. This is the name that will be visible to your fans and supporters on the platform. This is not the same as your username, you will be able to set that later.

### Email Address

Provide a valid email address that you can access. This email will be used for important notifications, account recovery, and communication with Fanmo.

### Password

Create a strong, secure password for your account. A good password should be a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Make sure it's something only you would know.

### Using Social Login

You can also use your Google or Facebook account to register on Fanmo. This is a quick and easy way to create your account, and you won't have to remember a separate password for Fanmo.

## Completing the Registration

After filling out the required information, click the "Create Account" button to complete your registration. If you used your email address to sign up, you'll receive an email from Fanmo with a verification code.

### Verifying Your Email

To activate your account and proceed further, check your email inbox for a message from Fanmo. If you don't see it in your inbox, make sure to look in your spam or junk folder as well. You can also request a new verification email from the Fanmo website.

Open the email from Fanmo, copy the verification code, and paste it into the verification form on the Fanmo website. You can also click the link in the email to verify your account. This step confirms that your email address is valid and that you have control over it.


### Setting Up Your Creator Profile

With your email verified, you can now proceed to set up your creator profile:

1. **Full Name**: Enter your full name. This will be used for your account and will not be visible to your fans.

2. **Contact**: Provide a link to your social media profile, website, blog, or any other online presence you have. Fill this out accurately, as it will be used to verify your identity as a creator.

### Connecting Your Bank Account

To receive earnings from your Fanmo activities, you'll need to connect your bank account. Fanmo takes security seriously, and your financial information is handled with the utmost care.

1. **Account Name**: Enter the name of the account holder. This should be the same as the name on your bank account.

2. **Account Number**: Enter your bank account number. This is the number that appears on your passbook and cheque book.

3. **IFSC Code**: Enter the IFSC code of your bank branch. This is a unique code that identifies your bank branch. You can find it on your cheque book or passbook.

4. **Account Type**: Select the type of account you have. Usually this is "Individual", choose the option that best describes your account.

Once you submit this information, Fanmo will verify your profile and bank details. This usually takes up to 2 working days. You'll receive an email from Fanmo once your bank account is verified.

You can also skip this step for now and connect your bank account later. However, you won't be able to receive payments until your bank account is verified. You can connect your bank account from the (/settings)[Settings] page on your Creator Dashboard later.
