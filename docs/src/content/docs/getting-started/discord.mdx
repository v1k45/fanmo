Fanmo offers seamless Discord integration to enhance your community engagement and provide exclusive benefits to your supporters. With Discord integration, you can automatically manage invitations and role assignments for your members, ensuring a smooth and rewarding experience for your fans. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of integrating Discord with your Fanmo account.

## What is Discord Integration?

Discord is a popular communication platform that allows communities to interact through text, voice, and video channels. By integrating Discord with Fanmo, you can offer your supporters access to your Discord server and assign roles based on their Fanmo membership status. This integration simplifies the management of your community, making it easier for both creators and supporters to enjoy the benefits.

## How Discord Integration Works

Discord integration on Fanmo operates in the following way:

1. **Automatic Role Assignment:** When supporters connect their Discord account to Fanmo, they will automatically be assigned roles on your Discord server based on their Fanmo membership tier. For example, if someone subscribes to a higher membership tier, they will receive corresponding privileges and roles on your Discord server.

2. **Access to Exclusive Channels:** Supporters who connect their Discord accounts will gain access to exclusive channels or features on your Discord server. These channels can be dedicated to discussions, Q&A sessions, or any content that you want to offer exclusively to your supporters.

3. **Role Updates:** If supporters upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their Fanmo memberships, their Discord roles will be updated accordingly to ensure they always have access to the appropriate channels and privileges.

7. **Select Your Discord Server:** Choose the Discord server where you want to enable this integration. Ensure that you have administrative privileges on the selected server.

8. **Assign Roles:** Specify which roles correspond to each Fanmo membership tier. This step ensures that supporters receive the appropriate roles when they join or upgrade their memberships.
