## What is Fanmo?

Fanmo is a platform for creators who want to earn a steady income by offering monthly memberships to their dedicated fans.
With Fanmo, you can follow your passion and build a sustainable income stream without the constraints of social media algorithms.

## How do I get paid?

All payments are instantly transferred to your bank account. You don't have to wait for a month to get hold of your money!

It could take up to 2 business days for the payouts to reach your account. If a fan pays you on Monday, you'll receive the money in your bank account before Thursday. 

## How much does Fanmo cost?

We take a 4.9% processing fee from your payments. If a fan pays Rs. 100 to you, you'll receive Rs. 95.10 in bank your account. There is no additional cost to use the platform. Unlike other platforms, we don't charge an extra transaction fee on top the advertised fee. 4.9%, that's it.

Fanmo is completely free to use. We don't charge any monthly fee to use any features, you can post content and engage with your fans even without accepting payments. We only make money when you do.

## Do you support UPI?

Yes! We love UPI. Your fans can use any UPI app for paying for tips.

For memberships, currently only PhonePe, Amazon Pay, Paytm, Google Pay and BHIM UPI are supported. This list will expand as soon as other UPI apps start supporting UPI AutoPay.

## How is Fanmo different?

Fanmo is an easy to use platform which has all the essentials which you'll need to build a stable income online. In addition to memberships, you can also accept one-time payments in form of tips, sell individual posts, connect to discord and much more. Fanmo is designed with Indian users in mind, our payment experience is friction-less, your fans don't even have to sign up to become a member or tip you.

We are the most affordable platform in the market. We believe creators should not lose a large chunk of their hard earned money just to communicate with their fans. We charge enough to keep the lights on and deliver features that add value. We don't believe in gouging creators to line our pockets.
